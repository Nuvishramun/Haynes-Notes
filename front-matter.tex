These are notes from a course taught by Haynes Miller at MIT in the fall of 1989 in honor of Frank Adams, after his passing.  They were originally taken by Matthew Ando, and were later transcribed into \LaTeX\ by Eric Peterson, with figures provided by Yi-Wei Chan, Meng Guo, and Matt Mahowald. Finally, the notes were edited for correctness and clarity and otherwise substantially improved by Michael Donovan and Aaron Mazel-Gee.

Due to the large number of different contributors, this document lacks the uniformity of style that the reader would normally expect. This may be corrected, some time in the near future.

If anything in this document confuses you, the original notes are available for comparison at the following links: \href{http://www-math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/vf1.pdf}{http://www-math.mit.edu/\string~hrm/papers/vf1.pdf}, \href{http://www-math.mit.edu/~hrm/papers/vf2.pdf}{http://www-math.mit.edu/\string~hrm/papers/vf2.pdf}.
